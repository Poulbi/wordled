# Wordled: Impress your friends with Wordle drawings!

## Overview
`Wordled` is a GUI application that lets you draw patterns such that you can later input them in the [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) game.  It will then generate the guesses to achieve the required pattern.
